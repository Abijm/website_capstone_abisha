			<h1>DOG</h1>
			<p class="palign">
				Dogs have a greater variance in behavioral and physical variation than any other land mammal, including wolves. Dogs have
				starch gel electrophoresis of red blood cell acid phosphatase. They also have smaller, compressed and crumpled tymphanic
				bullae. Physically, they have a more domed forehead and “stop” between the nose and forehead. Wolves have a more prominent
				temporalis muscle (the muscle that closes the jaws) and do not have dew claws on their back legs. Dogs lack a pre-caudal
				gland and go into estrus twice instead of once a year. Whereas dogs usually have brown eyes, wolves have amber or pale-colored
				eyes. Their skin is thicker and their paws are half the size of those of a wolf.

					setters, spaniels and pointers hunt game birds. Their coats are often thick and water-repellant to protect against the
					elements. Some examples of sporting dog breeds are <u><b>Golden Retriever</b></u>, Labrador Retriever, the Nova Scotia Dock Tolling Retriever, Cocker Spaniel and German Shorthaired Pointer.</p>
